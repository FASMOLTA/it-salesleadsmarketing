              <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/How-To-Handle-The-Gatekeepers-In-Your-IT-Lead-Generation-Campaign.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-324" title="How To Handle The Gatekeepers In Your IT Lead Generation Campaign?" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/How-To-Handle-The-Gatekeepers-In-Your-IT-Lead-Generation-Campaign.jpg" alt="How To Handle The Gatekeepers In Your IT Lead Generation Campaign?" width="350" height="230"></a>If there in one set of people that serves as a constant source of vexation for many marketers, both new and veteran, then it has to be the gatekeepers. They are the usual people who answer our marketing call or redirect us to another number. And they also happen to be the one challenge, the acid test, of anyone conducting a <strong>lead generation</strong> campaign in the IT industry. If they like you, then they will bring you to their boss. If not, well you need to try your luck better in generating sales leads for the next time. Now, we all have heard how hard handling gatekeepers are, but if you can keep in mind the five tips below, then you can go off with a good start.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Look for a vague person in charge – this is a strategy that is best done on the phone, so you will need the help of a professional <strong>IT telemarketing</strong> agency, in case you do not have one of your own. In this case, you request the gatekeeper to connect you to someone with a rather vague position in your target film. Usually, this will confuse them, prompting them to connect you to someone of a higher position. More often than not, this person is exactly you were looking for. Just be sure that the person’s title matches closely with the product or service you are offering them.</li>
                <li>Talk to your prospects before or after office hours – if you do this, then you will avoid facing the gatekeepers all together. Managers and other decision-makers usually are the last to leave work, so it might be a good idea for you to give this a try. Just make sure that you are not calling them in their homes, since this will create problems and complications that you just do not want to experience.</li>
                <li>Send an email beforehand – you may not receive the answer you want, but it is a good way to start the asking process. Try sending one to your prospect, or you can send it to the gatekeeper, asking him or her to forward your message to their boss. Sometimes, that can actually do what you requested of them.</li>
                <li>&nbsp;Ask their help – in this case, you are treating the gatekeeper not as your opponent, but as a partner in your marketing campaign. More often than not, these people are privy to the thoughts of the executives and business managers that they work for. And if your <strong>IT appointment setting</strong> team can establish a good rapport with them, they can actually provide you with details that can help your marketing campaign. Besides, if they feel that you are credible enough, they might end up connecting you directly to their boss.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>So there, these are just some of the tips that you can use in handling the gatekeepers of any business you wish to offer your services to. This will make generating B2B leads much easier for you.</p>

              <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/The-Lead-Generation-Networking-Mistake-Most-Marketers-Make1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-313" title="The Lead Generation Networking Mistake Most Marketers Make" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/The-Lead-Generation-Networking-Mistake-Most-Marketers-Make1.jpg" alt="The Lead Generation Networking Mistake Most Marketers Make" width="350" height="230"></a>Networking – the one activity that a lot of marketers should learn to develop. You see, establishing a connection with many business prospects is very important. As part of your <strong>lead generation</strong> efforts, you need to meet as many people as possible and identify as many potential sales leads as you can. This is something that sounds easy, right? After all, you can meet prospects anywhere, like in trade fairs, symposiums, seminars, even inside that coffee shop in the next street corner. The problem here is this is the one activity that is most likely to fail you. Why?</p>
              <p>You network too much.</p>
              <p>Now, before start protesting that this is wrong, that connecting with hundreds of people is essential to networking, you have to first consider what you are after in networking. What are you aiming for? If you just want to spread your name to the most number of people, then your argument will stand. But if you are after relationship-building and conversion of prospects into <strong>B2B leads</strong>, then you are doing networking wrong. You are spreading yourself to much, meeting and interacting with too many people. Just imagine butter spread on a slice of bread, spread too thin. It ruins the butter’s flavor and it does not do anything good for the bread. It is the same thing with you and over-networking.</p>
              <p>Let us face it, we have a limited capacity for establishing and maintaining relationships. While the numbers vary, research done by the University College in London revealed that our brain is only capable of handling no more than one hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty connections. This only shows just how far we can go before we go nuts. If we want to expand our network, we need to use add more capacity. To use the bread and butter analogy, we have to get another spoon of butter to fully and satisfyingly cover that slice of bread.</p>
              <p>So, what does it say about our <strong>appointment setting</strong> efforts, which also hinges on our networking skills?</p>
              <p>Basically, we have to focus more on quality over quantity. There is no point adding all those people on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, or whatever social networking tool you are using if you cannot manage them all properly. If you need to get more people, you need to add on your marketing team’s capacity. Hire more marketers or networkers. Let them concentrate on only a specific set of people. Nurture these leads, stay with them, fan the flames of interest, etc. Once you have successfully done that, you can then proceed with asking for the sale.</p>
              <p>Now, if you have issues about more in-house marketers (maybe due to budget or logistics), that should not be a problem at all. You can always outsource these tasks to professional lead generation or telemarketing agency. They would be most helpful in helping you connect with others, and turn them into paying customers later on. It is not a bad investment, as long as you work with the right agency.</p>
