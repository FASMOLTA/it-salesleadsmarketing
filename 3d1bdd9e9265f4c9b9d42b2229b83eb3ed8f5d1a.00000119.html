              <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/How-To-Generate-Qualified-Leads-With-Limited-budget.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-245" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/How-To-Generate-Qualified-Leads-With-Limited-budget.jpg" alt="How To Generate Qualified Leads With Limited budget" width="350" height="230"></a>Today, there are a lot of businesses even those that belong in the small-scale industries that are taking their endeavors to the next highest level, by getting on the internet, make their own virtual store or website and get people to visit it and, hopefully, make a sales through the products and services they are offering.&nbsp; However, just like when people do door-to-door selling or retail selling by having their own store somewhere around the city, they also need to generate qualified marketing leads or customer leads.&nbsp; Without any leads, no matter how good the products or the services are, no matter how good the marketing plan is, everything will be in shambles if they don’t have their own well-defined <strong>lead generation campaign</strong>.&nbsp; In the U.S. alone, many businesses have closed shops because they are not aware of how to generate and qualify leads.&nbsp; Some may have the method like advertising, business alliances, referrals, networking, to name a few. But, they are doing it the wrong way.&nbsp; Some may have even spent a lot of money but is now facing a blank wall.</p>
              <p>One of the reasons why some people fail to do better in their business because they already ignore one of the simplest yet most important and most effective way to generate qualified leads and that’s through the use of the telephone which is better known nowadays as <strong>telemarketing</strong>. Through the use of the telephone, anybody who wants his business to be noticed by people can save lots of time and money. Instead of doing the traditional drive-and-leg approach, they can just sit inside the comforts of their own offices, call somebody up and try his very best to get the recipient’s attention.&nbsp; This is much better than going around, step inside an office, introducing themselves and not knowing if they are talking with the right person or not.</p>
              <p>An effective lead generation campaign can instantly know if they are talking to the right decision maker.&nbsp; They know that there is a difference between introducing a product or service and introducing a solution.&nbsp; Before he can present the solution, he has the ability to unearth the needs of a potential customer, get him to agree for an appointment, meet face to face and at the end of the day, make a good deal.</p>
              <p>Today, to generate qualified leads with a minimum budget, any businessman should not ignore the importance of the telephone.&nbsp; It saves time and money and it can cover a wider field and can gather more leads and get more sales.</p>
