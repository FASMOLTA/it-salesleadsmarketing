              <p>Yes, you might think that voicemail is pretty old-fashioned in a B2B lead generation campaign for the IT market. But you have to admit that, in the event that your <a href="/sales-and-marketing/winning-more-it-sales-leads-without-the-price-cut-2/" target="_blank"><strong>sales leads</strong></a> prospects are not around, you really have to leave a voice message. Now, you know that successfully placing the right voice mail would elicit a positive reaction from your prospects. It is in how you should do it that really matters. Voice mails is pretty much an art that is slowly disappearing in today’s current business environment. So, here is the question: how can your voice mail compel <strong>B2B leads</strong> prospects to respond positively to you?</p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>State your name at the beginning and your number at the end</strong> – too many marketers these days often forget about this very important detail. Most tend to speed up when they say their callback numbers, while there are those who seem to mince words when they say their names. Be clear and succinct in these parts. If ever, these might be what your prospects need to read your.</li>
                <li>&nbsp;<strong>Leave a voicemail from your preferred callback number</strong> – in other words, you should use your office phone. Some marketers, for the sake of convenience in their work, call their prospect using personal phones, but make them call the office. Such complications are unnecessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Have a reference point as well as specific intent</strong> – the thing about voicemails is that the ones where you and your <strong>IT appointment setting</strong> prospects have a common denominator are usually returned. Also, if you state your purpose clearly on why you are calling them, they are more willing to call you back.</li>
                <li><strong>Be brief and plan well</strong> – the most effective voicemails are the ones that can tell you what they precisely need at the shortest possible time. This requires that you think critically about the composition of your message and how your prospects will hear it.</li>
                <li><strong>Do not ask questions</strong> – the purpose of voicemails is to get your prospects to call you, not to leave questionnaires. If you want to learn more about your prospects, ask them directly when they call you back. Or, you can also call them again and ask those questions. Take your pick.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Professionalism and enthusiasm</strong> – voicemails left by <a href="/telemarketing/be-better-in-it-telemarketing-in-five-ways/" target="_blank"><strong>telemarketing</strong></a> representatives can be returned if the one leaving it state their purpose in a professional and enthusiastic manner. This can be felt by the other party, even if you do not see each other. Stay upbeat, and courteous, and you can be sure to get a response.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Keep calling</strong> – when all else fails, a little persistence can go a long way. Try to call your prospects again when you still do not get a response from them. Who knows, maybe the second or third time calling is the charm. Just remember that you need to act as respectful as you can. You are asking for their business, not the other way around. You have to gain their favor at the start.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>There are other things you can do, but the tips above will put you right on track with your <strong><a href="/lead-generation/effective-lead-generation-curb-your-social-media-presence/" target="_blank">B2B lead generation</a></strong> campaign.</p>

              <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/What-IT-Companies-Get-When-Outsourcing-Appointment-Setting-Services.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-262" title="What IT Companies Get When Outsourcing Appointment Setting Services" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/What-IT-Companies-Get-When-Outsourcing-Appointment-Setting-Services.jpg" alt="What IT Companies Get When Outsourcing Appointment Setting Services" width="350" height="230"></a>IT companies are just some of the companies that are in-demand these days because they are some of the companies that make life very easy and convenient especially to other companies looking for some IT solutions that can help them with their business endeavors. These type of companies can offer different types of IT products and/or services like network management, VOIP/IP telephony, telecommunications, data warehousing, web hosting, web design, web development, security solutions and many more. With these products and/or services they are offering, companies find solutions for their current needs which can also catapult their own endeavors to newer and higher levels. However, if these IT companies can offer something like telecommunications solutions to their clients, why is it that they also need to outsource to appointment setting companies or call centers in order to generate qualified leads such as IT leads?</p>
              <p>The reason is very simple, actually. Yes, they do have that kind of IT solution for other companies that need telecommunications solutions. However, these IT companies don’t have the manpower with the right training to use this particular solution to generate those warm and qualified IT leads that they need in order to know more about their clients and vice versa. The decision makers of these companies have felt to have the need to make an alliance with appointment setting companies and outsource face-to-face appointment setting services which can be done by highly trained telemarketers of such telemarketing firms.</p>
              <p>If they can do outsourcing to a particular <strong>b2b telemarketing company</strong>, they will have all the time in the world in developing the IT solutions that they are offering to their potential clients. Have you noticed how fast software, hardware and IT solutions are evolving? A company avails, say, software solution like accounting software to help them with their financing and accounting tasks and before they know it, another newer version of the same software was introduced in the market and upon reviewing the new version, they have found out that a new feature is included that can give them the benefits that they are looking for.</p>
              <p>If these IT companies rely on their own in arranging face-to-face appointments through the efforts of their own telemarketers, they will need more time, spend more money and effort in providing the best training for their own people doing the <strong>appointment setting</strong> job and that could mean a possible backlog on their primary goal which is to develop the best IT solutions for their potential clients.</p>
              <p>If they do outsource to these b2b appointment setting lead generation companies, not only they can generate <strong>qualified IT leads</strong> through the efforts of these professional appointment setters but they can also avail other marketing methods and services like lead nurturing and management which is one of the most integral part in the whole lead generation process, they can also avail email marketing, social media marketing and SEO or search engine optimization and an outbound telemarketing company can even provide target call list upon request of their customer.</p>
